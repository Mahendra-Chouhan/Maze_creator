# Maze-Creator
The die images are specified using 1’s and 0’s over a 10 x 10 grid. The die will occupy a 5 x 5 area. The die could be anywhere within the 10 x 10 grid, but it will always be fully visible.

# Problem Statement
You have been hired by the board game company HasBoard, Inc. They are now venturing into the world of robotics and are building a robot that can play board games with you when no one else wants to! However, they need the robot to be able to see dice rolls and know what numbers come up. You’ve been given the task of writing the neural network that will interpret rolls of the dice. 

Specifically, you’ll be analyzing black and white images of a single die. The die images are specified using 1’s and 0’s over a 10 x 10 grid. The die will occupy a 5 x 5 area. The die could be anywhere within the 10 x 10 grid, but it will always be fully visible. The background of the image is black (0s) and the die face is white (1s) with black dots (0s). This is illustrated below. Your neural network must accept a list of a hundred 1’s and 0’s that represent the image of the die.
